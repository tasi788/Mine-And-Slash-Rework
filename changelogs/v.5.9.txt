- gems can no longer be socketed on runed items
- rune stats have been slightly nerfed
- rune and gem extractors are now datapack currencies and were slightly reworked
- added experimental mob persistence to maps. they will now save and load back if unloaded, so dying/coming back to maps shouldnt mean mobs are gone
- serverconfig is no longer needed for item compat, now you use "mmorpg:gear_slot_id" item tags. 
So just list all sword items in the "mmorpg:sword" item tag.

* Map Bosses!
A lot of you said maps felt aimless and there was nothing to complete, finish etc.
This update aims to change that in 2 ways.

First, every map now has a boss fight at the end, in their own arena, and to access it, you need to clear 50% of the map at the very least.
There was a lot of code needed to make this completition counter happen btw.. Like mob saving when they despawn.

Now, if you manage to kill the boss, it will spawn a teleport to the reward room!
The reward room will have a set amount of chests with added loot multipliers and better loot tables depending on your map completition %,
that % will be represented in rarities up to mythic.

This should mean cdr now works properly on charges
- station recipes now show up not right
- attempt fix stations not sometimes saving items
- try fix map spawning out of world borders
- map progress no longer needs scouting the entire map, but it's a bit random now
Each room counts the same, so if you enter a room and it's empty, you would get a boost to your map %
Other rooms might have tons of mobs or secret chests, and need way longer to finish. 
Also not a perfect system but probably more enjoyable to see your progress from the start
- added base_stat_percents to gear rar datapacks
- added cd to map teleport just in case
