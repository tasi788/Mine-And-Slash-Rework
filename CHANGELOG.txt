Changelog of recent updates: https://github.com/RobertSkalko/Mine-And-Slash-Rework/blob/1.20-Forge/changelogs/v.5.9.txt

v.5.9.18

- uniques now have a min_drop_lvl field
- quality now provides flat bonus to base stats instead of being a multiplier. 
- should fix mobs spawning with incorrect affix number in maps, mostly fixes bosses having affixes
- cdr stats now also have an additional effect: reduces charge cd (update the stat/effect datapacks)
This should mean cdr now works properly on charges
- station recipes now show up not right
- attempt fix stations not sometimes saving items
- try fix map spawning out of world borders
- map progress no longer needs scouting the entire map, but it's a bit random now
Each room counts the same, so if you enter a room and it's empty, you would get a boost to your map %
Other rooms might have tons of mobs or secret chests, and need way longer to finish. 
Also not a perfect system but probably more enjoyable to see your progress from the start
- added base_stat_percents to gear rar datapacks
- added cd to map teleport just in case
- updated translations
